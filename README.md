# Cognitive OS Framework

Personal cognitive architecture for identity integrity and multi-agent systems.

⚠️ This is a technical demonstration — NOT an "AI brain" product. It shows how to build a self-verifying system using POSIX tools (bash, sha256sum, find) without LLM dependency for integrity verification.

## Quick Start (Demo Mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrishiotech/cognitive-os-framework.git
cd cognitive-os-framework
./scripts/master_sync.sh
Core Principles
Identity Integrity > LLM Roleplay
Verify state with sha256sum — not LLM hallucinations.
Sensitive vs Logical Separation
Never mix personal data (phone, RFC) with public identity.
Multi-Agent Constraints
Agents enforce protocols (KETOR, GEMA Guardian) — they don't "think like you".
Demo Data Only
All data in demo/ is fictional (Alex Rivera, TechGlobal Inc).
⚠️ Never commit your real SSOTs to public repos.
License
MIT — fork freely, but this solves my problem, not a general market need.
